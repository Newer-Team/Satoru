# This tool is UNFINISHED and NOT MAINTAINED. Use at your own risk.
Additional note: Run OneTileset Creator (with a 64-bit version of Python, or it runs out of memory) and getPa0s (via command line) before starting Satoru.

Keep in mind that OneTileset Creator may render your computer unusable for the duration of its operation; it constantly opens new windows that are automatically in focus, which makes it impossible to do anything that requires another window to be focused. It may take a while, so don't open it if you need to do something else important soon after.

Original README below. 

# Satoru
A level editor for NSMBU and NSLU, based on Reggie! Next by RoadrunnerWMC, which is based on Reggie by Treeki, Tempus et al. Uses PyQt5, Python 3, TPLLib, and other libs. It uses an entirely new and flexible paradigm for handling objects.

# How To Use
First, download this repo (either by using ```git clone``` or ```git pull``` if you've already cloned it), or by downloading a release, or by just downloading this repo as a whole.

Second, you need the filesystem for New Super Mario Bros. U. We do not supply this due to copyright reasons, so to obtain a copy you should extract it with a Wii U and legally-acquired disc or digital download.

Thirdly, once you have the filesystem, run ```run.bat``` (or run the EXE, if you're using a release) and on first run, it should ask you to choose a folder. Choose the course_res_pack folder, or where you've stored the levels.

You also need to install [AMD Compress](https://archive.org/download/amdcompress-2.2.2740/AMDCompress_2.2.2740.exe).

Enjoy.
